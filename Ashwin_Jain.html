<h3>Review of Lecture: </h3>
<ol>
    <li>Professor Raj Jain starts by detailing HTTP Concepts such as how different server communicate with clients and 
        explains how hypertext was extended to where it is possible to go from one page to another.  </li>
    <li>Webpage is group of objects and includes text, images, files. Webpages are usually written in HTML.</li>
    <li>Web cookies were invented to allow the server to keep state, remember users, and guide them on what to do. Instead of seeting up TCP connection for every object, persistent 
        conncection allowed to open just one connection.</li>
    <li>Professor shows how HTTP protocol uses GET request along with URL, HTTP Version, 
        and header fields to retrieve the webpage. HTTP uses Ascii messages for more readibility. Proxy Server recieves the requests from clients and caches information
        in order to give quicker response to client. Only new objects are requested from server.</li>
</ol>
  <h3> What I learned: </h3>
        I learned that HTTP uses text based ascii method insted of binary for improved readibility. Also most webpages are written with HTML and can be retrieved with a
        conditional GET method. I also learned that servers transitioned from non-persistant to persistent TCP connections sas people are not as concerned with saving BITS
        now that we have more storage. Lastly I saw how the cookies help maintaining state with server by remembering infomration and how the proxy servers improve performance
        by caching webpages from different clients. 
    <h3>Suggestions: </h3>
<ul>
    <li>Can explain the different HTTP methods and different parts of URL some more</li>
    <li>Can show more examples of webpages and how the GET method works to retrieve page</li>
</ul>
